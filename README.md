Description :
In this project we will try to predict the “true” ratings for movies. Our assumption in this endeavor is that “true” ratings are sufficiently approximated by Metacritic scores of movies. The aim of this project is to use properties on the graph generated by the Amazon users and movie ratings, and obtain the value of these “true” ratings, using data from Metacritic for training and testing.
